# BSTestApps

Simple workspace with two projects, ARC and non-ARC that just loads
BSManagedDocument.

This serves two purposes:

1. It provides test applications as examples of using the class.
2. It provides a convenient place to put the unit tests.

This is in a separate branch so that projects that want to use the class as a
subrepasitory can opt to use the branch that only includes the class files not
the examples or the test scaffolding.
