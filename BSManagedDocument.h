//  A document class that mimics UIManagedDocument to support Core Data in all its modern glory:
//
//  *   Saves to a file package
//
//  *   On 10.7+, asynchronous saving is supported. We set up a parent/child pair of contexts; the parent saves on its own thread
//
//  *   Full support for concurrent document opening too
//
//  *   Subclasses can hook in to manage additional content inside the package
//
//  *   A hook is also provided at the best time to set metadata for the store
//
//  *   New docs have the bundle bit set on them. It means that if the doc gets transferred to a Mac without your app installed, with the bundle bit still intact, it will still appear in the Finder as a file package rather than a folder
//
//  *   If the document moves on disk, Core Data is kept informed of the new location
//
//  *   If multiple validation errors occur during saving, the presented error is adjusted to make debugging a little easier
//
//  *   And of course, full support for Autosave-In-Place and Versions
//
//  NOTE: There is currently a MAJOR flaw in Core Data's handling of EXTERNALLY STORE DATA ATTRIBUTES if you're planning to use them in your document's model
//  The subsystem that deals with externally stored attributes is unable to deal with the persistent store being moved/renamed. It will attempt to work with external data at the OLD store location, instead of the new, and throw an exception when it fails to do that
//  The described scenario happens whenever a user moves or renames the document (this is supposed to be support behaviour on OS X). But just as importantly, when a new document gets explicitly saved by the user for the first time, it transitions from being stored in a temporary folder, to the real location, also triggering the bug
//  Only happens when there is data added to the document large enough for Core Data to try and store it externally, so make sure you take that into account if trying to repro!
//  Reported as rdar://problem/13023874
//  Filing a duplicate of the report, highly appreciated. It might be worth filing a DTS incident if this affects your app to see if they can offer a workaround
//
